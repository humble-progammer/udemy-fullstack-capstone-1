## Requirements
To keep the project within scope (time, energy, resources), you may **only use HTML** to complete this project.  
Even if you know CSS or JavaScript, this project must be done using **HTML only**.

Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. There will be things you:
- Don’t know yet  
- Want to do but haven’t learned  
- Need to research  

As a professional, you should know your limitations and look up answers using Google, MDN docs, and other reputable resources.

## FAQs

### 1. Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews?

**Yes! Absolutely.**

That is the entire purpose of these Capstone Projects.  
Unlike course projects (which include solution code and walkthroughs), Capstone Projects are **entirely your own work**.

Because millions of students take this course, employers can easily recognize the course projects.  
Capstone projects:
- Have no solution code  
- Have no walkthrough  
- Have no design specs  
- Are entirely your own creation  

This makes them excellent additions to your portfolio.

> As a hiring manager, I value what developers build **themselves** far more than the school they attended or whether they have a computer science degree. Many CEOs agree.

### 2. What if I don't remember how to do something?

That’s normal! Watching a video doesn’t guarantee mastery.  
These Capstone Projects help reveal:
- Weak areas  
- Things you forgot  
- Things you need to review  

When you get stuck, use the opportunity to:
- Review previous lessons  
- Revisit documentation  
- Strengthen your understanding  

This is how real developers learn and grow.
