        <p>I build systems that can’t go down.</p>
        <p>For the last 18+ years, I’ve been designing and delivering scalable, fault-tolerant, high-performance distributed
        platforms that quietly keep some of the world’s largest organizations running.</p>
        <p>My journey started in the low-level trenches — writing Unix/Linux device drivers, optimizing storage stacks, and
        debugging kernel-level code — and grew into architecting enterprise-scale distributed systems used across SaaS, PaaS,
        and hybrid cloud environments. Along the way, I’ve designed distributed filesystems, large-scale backup/recovery
        platforms, ETL pipelines, and graph/SQL abstractions that have been deployed at massive scale.</p>


        <p>Inventor on ~12 patents in distributed systems, storage, and data workflows.</p>


        <p>I love solving hard problems with first-principles thinking, but equally enjoy mentoring engineers, growing strong
        technical cultures, and translating complex architectures into solutions that just work.
        If you’re working on something ambitious in the world of distributed systems, storage, or large-scale data platforms,
        I’m always happy to connect, share ideas, or help troubleshoot that stubborn scaling issue that’s been keeping you up at
        night.</p>
