        <h2> Profile </h2>

            <p> I am a software architect with 18+ years of experience designing and delivering
                <strong>scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant distributed systems</strong> and
                enterprise-grade infrastructure software. My work spans <strong>distributed filesystems,
                storage platforms, backup/recovery services, ETL pipelines, and data access frameworks</strong>
                — solutions that power mission-critical workloads for some of the world’s largest
                organizations.</p>

            <p>I specialize in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turning <strong>complex distributed systems problems</strong> into robust, performant, maintainable solutions.</li>
                <li>Designing from <strong>first principles</strong> and rapidly iterating based on real-world feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Leading projects</strong> from concept through delivery, often on high-visibility, high-impact projects.</li>
                <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> engineers across all career stages to help them thrive in R&D organizations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>With a dozen issued or filed <strong>patents in distributed computing</strong> as well as academic publications in network algorithms, I’ve built a
            track record for innovation at scale — from architecting systems that process 10s of PBs of data daily, to frameworks
            that broaden development access from a handful of experts to entire organizations.</p>
